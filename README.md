tshark-json
===========

tshark to json and gource with node


````bash
How to install:
- install nodejs
- install tshark/wireshark
- clone this repo
- 'npm install' in repo
- set your network device (current 'en0')
- 'sudo node app.js'
````

The idea is that it should poop out json, which might even be used to parse to other apps.
Gource and JSON support is lame, as its not (at all) accurate or working.
